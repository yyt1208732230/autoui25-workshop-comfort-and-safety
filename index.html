				<h2>Workshop Schedule</h2>
				<p>This 2.5-hour workshop is structured into interactive sessions with expert talks, group discussions,
					and reflections. It aims to evaluate existing measurement methods and collaboratively explore
					innovative, multi-modal approaches, including AI-based strategies.</p>

				<div class="features">

						<h3>Welcome & Introduction (10 min)</h3>
						<p>
							â€¢ Introduction of organisers and guest speakers.<br>
							â€¢ Overview of the workshop goals, activities, and schedule.<br>
							â€¢ Division of participants into two breakout groups.

						<h3>Session 1: Setting the Scene (75 min incl. 5 min break)</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Organisersâ€™ Introduction (10 min):</strong> Definitions of comfort and perceived
							safety, overview of current measurement approaches, and identification of existing
							challenges and gaps.<br><br>
							<strong>Expert Talks (60 min):</strong><br>
							â€¢ Subjective methods: their benefits and limitations.<br>
							â€¢ Objective methods: challenges in physiological and behavioural data use (e.g., artefact
							removal, variability).<br>
							â€¢ AI-based models: insights and lessons from applying AI for passenger state detection.

						<h3>Session 2: Group Discussions (40 min)</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Task 1: Critical Assessment (20 min):</strong><br>
							Participants evaluate challenges and share solutions based on measurement categories
							(subjective, objective). Output is visualised on a shared whiteboard.<br><br>
							<strong>Task 2: Designing Future Methods (20 min):</strong><br>
							Groups propose a multi-modal framework for continuous comfort and safety assessment,
							integrating subjective, objective, and behavioural data. Special focus is placed on the role
							of AI/LLMs in real-time inference.

				<h3>Expected Outcome</h3>
				<p>This workshop aims to establish a shared, community-driven understanding of how to measure passenger
					comfort and perceived safety in automated vehicles. By synthesising practical experiences with
					current methodologies, participants will gain a clearer view of the strengths, challenges, and best
					practices in the field.</p>
				<p>Key outcomes include a collaboratively defined research agenda and a publicly shared methodological
					paper focusing on multi-modal measurement and the use of AI. The session also seeks to foster a
					strong professional network to drive future collaboration on advancing measurement strategies.</p>
